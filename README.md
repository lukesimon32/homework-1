* First homework assignment for refactory. Repository named Homework-1

* * In this assignment, I adjusted the code in the HTML file to semantic code. Once adjusted, I adjusted the CSS code as well so that all image paths and links lined up. along with that, I consolodated the CSS code to make it easier to navigate. I added comments above each section that got consolodated to make them easier to spot.

* * * The style of the website stayed exactly the same. All functions mirror the example website as well.
